# Config explanation

With the /neo protect setup command, all config settings, apart from 'Language:' and 'autoUpdateIP:', are set automatically and should not normally be changed yourself.

```
# Don't change anything here if you don't know what you're doing
APIKey: '' # The API-KEY is set automatically during setup
ProxyProtocol: true # Needed to forward the player's IP through the NeoProtect Proxy
Language: en-US # en-US or de-DE (Add new file to /language for more available language https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html)
gameshield:
  serverId: '' # The serverID is set automatically during setup
  backendId: '' # The backendID is set automatically during setup
  autoUpdateIP: false # This setting automatically sets the IP of the NeoProtect backend every 10 seconds
```
