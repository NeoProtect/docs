# ðŸ‘‹ Getting started

Let's discover how to protect your Minecraft server **in less than 5 minutes**.

:::caution

This documentation is still a work in progress.
If you need help please visit our [Discord Server](https://discord.neoprotect.net).

:::

## 1. Signup

Visit our [Panel](https://panel.neoprotect.net) and register an account.
After logging in navigate to the `Server` page.

## 2. Add your first server
Click on "Create Server" to add your Minecraft server.
This could be a simple vanilla server or even a multi-server network using Velocity or BungeeCord.
A server can be named anything you'd like and you can change the name after the initial setup.

A server/network can have multiple domains and backend servers.

## 3. Set up your Domain

Take a look here: [Domain Setup](setup/dns.md)


## 4. Configure proxy protocol

_While it is recommended to use the following instructions you are able to configure it manually_

- Download our plugin which you can find [here](https://github.com/NeoProtect/NeoPlugin/releases/latest)
- Put the plugin in your backends plugin folder (If you have a network, put it onto your proxy only)
- Re-start your proxy/server and join your server with the permission **neoprotect.admin**
- Follow the in-game setup (The api key can be found [here](https://panel.neoprotect.net/profile) under "API")
- And you are done and should see the IPs of your players

## Finished!
