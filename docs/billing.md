# How to pay?

## Prepaid

Our billing concept is based on the prepaid system.
Before you can buy any plan you need to top up your account balance using a payment method (see below).
Once the payment is completed your balance becomes available.

## Accepted payment methods

We provide automatic payments through **PayPal** and **Crypto (BTC, XMR)** on our panel.
It can take some minutes for the payment to be verified. Feel free to contact our [Support](support.md) if
you have any issues.

You can also pay using other cryptocurrencies (e.g. LTC) through a ticket
on our [Discord](https://discord.neoprotect.net).

For transactions over 200â‚¬ we would appreciate if you contact us beforehand.

## Do you only have the plans listed?
No, we would be more than happy to provide you with your own completely custom-made solution.
Just contact us, and we will get it ready for you!
